           it's obvious problems as much to offer  that's if you're going to be doing that otherwise it's to completely will to give a gun to a friend or what have you so i think that it creates an entire underbelly of the market that really shouldn't exist i mean yeah for not keeping track from as gun where they're buying it sounded i think guns going the wrong people's hands i will leave while the reports on the investigation team analyzed for shutting it was a kick out socially add actually i put it together himself families that and supported guns his dad i think was a bullet maker i think they were going to get vowels no matter what like if they want out there going to get a gun so definitely is different from state to state her in california it's very difficult and illinois it's difficult and the crazy thing as you see a lot of gun violence and as states by new hampshire it's a constitutional carry a new guy in going to have to have a permit you can conceal carry and they have virtually no homicides and can so i'm just curious knew what you're asking fire basically is like a national registry for firearms right of we could do that one i hate that i feel like if you back in history and never worked out for citizens is you look back and germany he like of venezuela right now fair points and i read somewhere that you know if you have a controlled substance possession charge of last year uki'm got guy and if you have had a misdemeanor sense to over two years in prison you can't have a gun and these are these are great safeguards they need to just be imposed more i think it'd be easier is the only constitutional right that you those with a conviction like you come out of prison you still okay have freedom of speech but now you no longer protect yourself now i understand people can do stuff to believe themselves even have the right to life i believe that you can give up your rights look bly based on your actions but i think we make it too easy to give up those rights and then when you add in the racial component to these laws that makes me even more of an advocate against these common gun restrictions
